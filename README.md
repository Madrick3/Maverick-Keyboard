#Maverick-Keyboard

This repository if primarily for private use. I designed and built my own keyboard using a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller.
The total cost came to just under $100, if you are for whatever interested, contact me or make an issue in this repo and i'll see how I can help.
If you are serious about making a keyboard, please look to the following resources.
